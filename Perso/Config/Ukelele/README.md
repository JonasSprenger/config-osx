# Characters mapping
Use [Key Codes](https://manytricks.com/keycodes/) to find the `key code` number associated with the an event (code displayed by Karabiner-EnventViewer is not correct!) 

# Ukelele

## CLI installation (only layout):
To use a KeyLayout created with Ukelele you must copy as root the layout file in `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts`.

```
sudo cp My_Custom.keylayout /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts
```

## GUI installation (bundle with icons):
- Open the *.bundle or create a new with `File` => `New KeyboardLayout Collection`
- Create an png file 32x32 with `GIPM`
( it sims also possible to edit direcly the `*.icns` wiht the preview App)
- Use [easyicon.net](https://www.easyicon.net/language.en/covert/) to transform it to an `*.icns`
- Attach the icon from `Keyboard` menu or with a right click.
- Save the bundle
- Export as `*.dmg` for install all layout of the bundle

# TODO: Try to install it directly with `Ukelele`
